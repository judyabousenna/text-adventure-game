Text-Based Adventure Game

About the Game?

This is a Python-powered, fantasy-themed text adventure game where the player navigates choices and faces off against dark forces threatening a magical kingdom. The game uses interactive storytelling, randomized outcomes, and conditional logic to create a replayable experience.

You awaken in a mysterious forest, guided by an unknown voice and thrown into a conflict against a powerful enemy. Your decisions will determine whether you save the kingdom or fall to darkness.

Why This Matters?

This project was part of my learning journey in the DECI Nanodegree program (Udacity). It reflects my passion for creating, problem solving, and using storytelling to build systems that engage and challenge.
